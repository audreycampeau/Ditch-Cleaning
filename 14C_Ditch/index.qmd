# Import and visualise the database

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Importer libraries
library(tidyverse) 
library(plotly) 
library(readxl) 
library(DT) # for interactive datatables
library(leaflet) #for interactive maps
library(htmltools)
library(rstatix) #anova test
library(ggpubr)# show reg.line equation 

#Open dataset
C14_wide_chemistry <- readRDS(file = "Output/Data/C14_wide_chemistry.rds")

DC_Q <- readRDS(file= "Output/Data/DC_Q.rds")

# Define Color Ramp and theme

# Hydrological Response

Is the radiocarbon age of DOC and CO~2~ controled by runoff, and does it changes after treatment?

## Scatterplot

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


# Hydrological response, DC sites
ggplot( filter(DC_Q, Treatment %in% c("Ditch cleaning","Clearcut", "Pristine" )),# %>%
       #filter(Site_id %in% c("DC1", "DC2", "DC3", "DC4")),#%>%
         #filter(Study_Source != "Audrey"), 
       aes(y=DOC_14C_Modern, x=q_md, fill=Treatment, color=Treatment))+ #size=DOCmgL_14C, 
  geom_point(size=3, aes(shape=Site_id))+
  scale_shape_manual(values=sites_symbols)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=treatments_colors)+ #"
  labs(x="specific discharge at DC3 (m/d)", y=bquote("âˆ†"^14*"C-DOC  (% modern)"), shape="Watershed ID")+
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,0.025))+
  
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, aes(color=Treatment), show.legend = F)+
  scale_color_manual(values=treatments_colors)+ #"
  stat_regline_equation(
  label.y.npc = "bottom", label.x.npc = 0.40,
  aes(label =  paste(..eq.label.., ..adj.rr.label.., sep = "~~~~"), color = Treatment), 
  show.legend = F, size=4)+

theme(legend.position = "right")

```

## ANCOVA test

### Is there a significant difference in the hydrological response between treatments?

```{r, warning=F, echo=FALSE}
#Run ANCOVA test - Difference in hydro. response between treatments
filter(DC_Q, Treatment %in% c("Ditch cleaning","Clearcut", "Pristine" )) %>% 
  anova_test(DOC_14C_Modern ~ q_md*Treatment)
```

The effect of x (q_md) is significant, and the effect of intercept (Treatment) is also significant. But the differences in slopes are not significant.

Essentially, there is a positive response of the 14C-DOC to dischage, and the effect of treatment shifts the age towards more positive (younger) values, without changing the hydrological response (slope).

### Is there a significant difference in the hydrological response between sites?

```{r, warning=F, echo=FALSE}
#Run ANCOVA test - Difference in hydro. response between Sites
filter(DC_Q, Treatment %in% c("Ditch cleaning","Clearcut", "Pristine" )) %>% 
  anova_test(DOC_14C_Modern ~ q_md*Site_id)
```

There is no significant difference between sites in this relationship.
